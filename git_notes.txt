Git basics: anything that is committed in Git can almost always be recovered. Even commits that were on branches that were deleted or commits that were overwritten with an --amend commit can be recovered (see Chapter 9 for data recovery). However, anything you lose that was never committed is likely never to be seen again.

** @KentBeck: finally figuring out that git commands are strangely named graph manipulation commands--creating/deleting nodes, moving pointers around.

** Most Git's power comes from the way it looks at the world. (computer scientists see the world)

** git repository is a graph, every git commit is a node. Nodes can point toother nodes that came before them. Most commits point to one parrent commit, merge commits point to two (or more!) parent commits.

** gits operations do two things: 1) make nodes (build commits) 2) move labels (from one commit to another)

** A git commit is a node in a graph, and nodes can point to other nodes that came before them.

** Cheap branching: a local branch reference contains 40-byte identifier of the commit that the reference points to. The entire file is 40 byte.

** local branch reference  : commit, merge, rebase, reset
   remote branch reference : fetch, push
   tag reference           : tag

** REFERENCE MAKE COMMITS REACHABLE, ($git gc), starting from every branch and every tag, git walks back through the graph, building a list of every commit it can reach, Once it's reached the end of every path, it deletes all the commits it didn't visit.

** possible to have all user fetching/pulling from the same "origin", but push to their own repository branch


remote branches: (can be viewed as read-only branches)

$git branch -r        # show remote branches

** remote branches represent commits from somebody else's repository. Remote
branches can be check out just like a local, but put user in a detached HEAD (like chekcing out old commits)


========================================================================================================


fetching from remote: $git fetch <remote_shortname>
                                                     <branch_desired_on_remote>       # only fetching the specified branch from remote

**If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name origin if no remote_shortname specified. "$git fetch
<remote_shortname (ex.origin)> fetches any new work that has been pushed to
that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it. It's important to note
that the fetch command pulls the data to your local repository — it doesns't automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you're currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you're ready.


ex.
  $git checkout master                  # swtich to local master branch
  $git fetch origin master              # update with remote/master(origin)
  $git rebase -i  origin/master         # rebase local master with remote/master(origin)
  $git push origin master               # push local master to remote/master(origin)

** since we already made sure the local master was up-to-date, this should result in a fast-forward-merge, and "$git push" should not complain.
========================================================================================================


merge: $git merge <branch>
                  --no-ff <branch>      # causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward.
                                        ** This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.

use merge tool: $git mergetool

========================================================================================================


pulling from remote: $git pull <remote_shortname>   

** $git pull <remote_shortname> <branch> ??

**Running git pull generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you're currently working on. 
**PULL = FETCH + merge

$git pull --rebase <remote_shortname>     # instead of using "$git merge" after "$git fetch" to integrate the remote branch with local, use "$git rebase" instead

ex.
  $git checkout master              # switch back to local master branch
  #git pull --rebase origin         # rebase off remote origin/master



** the --rebase option can be used to ensure a linear history by preventing unnecessary merge commits. Many developer prefer rebasing over merging, since it's like saying "I want to put my changes on top of what everybody else has done", in this sense, "$git pull --rebase" is more like a svn update


========================================================================================================


pushing to remote: $git push <remote_shortname> <local_branch_name>
                             <remote_shortname> <local_branch_name>:<new_remote_branch_name>    #rename remote branch name
                             -f <shortname(ex.origin)> <branch_name(ex.master)>    # a "forced push" and overwrites the branch on the server, coould be DANGEROUS when working with a team!


$git push <remote_shortname> --force      # same as "-f"
$git push <remote_shortname> --all        # push all local branches to the specified remote
$git push <remote_shortname> --tags       # tags are usually not pushed when using "--all" option, the "--tag" sends all local tags to the remote repository


** the --force(--f) flag overrides the prevent of non-fast-forward and makes the remote repository's branch match the local one, DELETING any upstream changes that may have occured since the last pull. The only time one should ever need to force push is when one realize that the commits that was just shared were not quite right and need to be fixed with a "$git commit --amend" or an interactive rebase. However, one must be absolutely certain that none of the others working on the same branch have pulled the commits before using the --force(-f) option.


** in addition, push should only made to repositories that had been created with --bare, since pushing messes with the remote branch structure. It's important to not push to another developer's repository. But because --bare repos don't have a working directory, it's impossible to interrupt anybody's development.


** ex. cloning generally sets up both names automatically $git push origin master


========================================================================================================


Tagging: to tage specific points in history as being important, for ex. release points etc.

listing/show tags: git tag       # in alphabetical order
                      -l 'tag_to_be_search_for.1.*'   # search tag for particular pattern

**lightweighted tag(branch): a pointer to a specific commit. temporary or don't want to keep other information

$git tag <tag_name>


**annotated tag: stored as full objects in the Git database. Contain tagger name, e-mail, date, tagging message, are checksummed and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard(GPG). Recommanded.

$git tag -a <tag_name> -m 'tag message'
         -s <tag_name>  #tag is signed with GPG, only if it's available
         -v <tag_name>  #verify a signed tag

revert:

$git revert <commit>      # generate a new commit that undoes all of the changes introduced in the current branch.

** Used when an entire commit from project history needs to be removed.

** "$git revert" undoes a "single commit", but does not revert back to the previous state of a project by removing all subsequent commits.

** instead of deleting the reverted commit, git adds a new commit to undo its changes. As a result, there will exist two exact same code base (the commit in history and the new commit). 


========================================================================================================

clean: 

$git clean -f         # -f flag is required unless clean.requireForece is set to false(true by default). WILL NOT REMOVE UNTRACKED FOLDERS OR FILES SPECIFIED BY .gitignore
           -n         # a dry run, will only show which files were to be removed without actually doing it.
           -f <path>  # limit operation to the specified path
           -df        # remove untracked files and untracked directories from current directory
           -xf        # remove untracked files as well as any files that GIT usually ignores from current directory


** often executed in conjunction with "$git reset --hard". Resetting only affects tracked files, so a seperate command is required for cleaning up untracked ones. Combining the reset and clean, one can return the working directory to the exact state of a particular commit.


========================================================================================================

branches:


** creating branch is like requesting a new project history.

$git branch                        # list all of the branches in the current repository
             <branch_name>         # create a new branch called <branch_name>
             -d <branch_name>      # delete <branch_name>, "safe" in a way that it prevents deletion of any unmerged changes
             -D <branch_name>      # force delete <branch_name>, used when all commits associated with a particular line of development is wished to be thrown away 
             -m <branch_rename>    # rename the current branch to <branch_rename>


ex. $git branch experiment_branch
    $git checkout
    $git add

rebase:   ** moving a branch from one commit to another

** internally, new commits are created and applied to the specific base, a rewriting of project history.

$git rebase <base(branch/commit_ID/tag/HEAD~n)>

** primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history. A situation where the master branch has progressed since the last a feature_branch has started devloping. Two options to integrate are 1)merging directly, and 2)rebase+merging. Option 1 result in a 3 way merge and merge commit, option 2 result in a fast-forward merge and a linear history.

** should never rebase commits that have been pushed to a public repository.

$git rebase -i <base>       # rebase using an interactive rebasing session

** opens an editor for each commands to be rebased, determine how individual commits will be transferred to the new base.

** interactive rebasing allow user to go back and clean up afterwards, developers likes to repolish a feature branch before merging it into the main code base.

========================================================================================================

reflog(reference log?): 

$git reflog                     # show the reflog for the local repository
             --relative-date    # show reflog with relative date information


** everytime the current HEAD gets updated(switching branches, pulling in changes, rewritting history, adding new commmits...) a new entry will be added to the reflog

** reflog only provides a safety net if changes have been commited to local repository and that it only tracks movements.
